<h1> Will AI destroy our civilization.  </h1><br />
<br />
When I first encountered John Hopfield's associative learning back in 1991, I was struck by the similarities between his network and the complex workings of the human brain. This lead me to study the relationship between machine learning and our internal neural networks. I concluded that machine learning is only related to human neurons as a metaphor.<br />
<br />
In the decades since, there has been much advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence. While these technologies are powerful and useful, they are no substitute for the power of the human brain. We must remember that the real potential of machine learning lies in its potential to augment the power of the human mind, not replace it.<br />
<br />
As we continue to explore the potential of machine learning, we must be mindful that the technology will never be able to replicate the complexity of the human brain. We must continue to be innovative and creative in our use of machine learning, as it is only through this kind of exploration that we can truly unlock its potential.</body>
